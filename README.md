Expenditure data analysis internship project from Ineuron.ai

Problem statement

No business can survive in this competitive market without managing their cost. It does not matter if revenues are high but if cost is higher it is a red flag. So you are tasked to help management in creating and establishing new structures and models to reduce cost. Do ETL: Extract-Transform-Load the dataset and find for me some information from this large data. This is a form of data mining. The dataset as listed on the NITI Aayog website from 1980_81 to 2015_16 What all information can be achieved by mining this data would be brainstormed by the interns Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes. Do your own research and come up with your findings.

Introduction

An Expenditure Data Analysis is a project related to Exploratory data analysis(EDA)and Data visualization of expenditure datasets from NITI Aayog of India. I used Python libraries to get expenditure information and visualize different aspects of it, and finally, I worked on a few ways of analyzing the spending of expenditure based on its previous performance history states in India. First, extract the dataset, prepared data, clean, load, and transform it into Power BI desktop Then create an interactive insightful dashboard and publish it on Novypro.
